Flutter-based mobile app for **clinical pain tracking** using **VAS/NRS** scales.
Includes patient **enrollment flow**, a **gamification** layer, and an **offline-first** approach (sync-ready).

## What it does
- Record pain scores (VAS/NRS) with timestamps
- Support patient onboarding/enrollment
- Encourage regular reporting via gamification elements
- Work reliably in real conditions (offline-first)

## Why this repo is named `MedPharmApp_lib`
This repository contains the **`lib/` source code** (core app features).
It can be used as:
